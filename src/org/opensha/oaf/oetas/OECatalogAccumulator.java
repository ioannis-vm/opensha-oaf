// Interface for accumulating results from a set of catalogs of Operational ETAS ruptures.
// Author: Michael Barall 12/30/2019.
//
// This interface is an object that can consume the contents of a multiple
// realizations of an operational ETAS catalog, so as to calculate fractiles
// of the aftershock distribution.  It typically bins the aftershocks.

public interface OECatalogAccumulator {

	//----- Factory methods -----

	// Make a catalog consumer.
	// Returns a consumer which is able to consume the contents of one catalog
	// (or several catalogs in succession).
	// This function may be called repeatedly to create several consumers,
	// which can be used in multiple worker threads.
	// Threading: Can be called in multiple threads, before or after the call to
	// begin_accumulation, and while there are existing open consumers, and so
	// must be properly synchronized.
	// Note: The returned consumer cannot be opened until after the call to
	// begin_accumulation, and must be closed before the call to end_accumulation.
	// Note: The returned consumer can be opened and closed repeatedly to consume
	// multiple catalogs.

	public OECatalogConsumer make_consumer ();


	//----- Control methods -----

	// Begin accumulating catalogs.
	// Parameters:
	//  capacity = The number of catalogs that will be accumulated.
	// This function should be called before any other control methods.
	// The accumulator should allocate resources so it can hold results
	// from at least the specified number of catalogs.
	// Threading: No other thread should be accessing this object,
	// and none of its consumers can be open.
	// Design note: The number of catalogs is specified in advance, because
	// automatically increasing the capacity on-demand is likely to require
	// expensive synchronization, and typically the expected number of catalogs
	// is known.

	public void begin_accumulation (int capacity);

	// Increase the capacity of the accumulator.
	// Parameters:
	//  capacity = The number of catalogs that will be accumulated.
	// This function can be called to increase the capacity of the accumulator
	// above its original or prior setting.
	// Note that this is likely to be an expensive operation, in part because
	// all worker threads must be idled.
	// Threading: No other thread should be accessing this object,
	// and none of its consumers can be open.

	public void increase_capacity (int capacity);

	// End accumulating catalogs.
	// This function should be called after all other control functions.
	// It provides an opportunity for the accumulator to finish its binning.
	// Note that the final number of catalogs can be less than the configured capacity.
	// Threading: No other thread should be accessing this object,
	// and none of its consumers can be open.

	public void end_accumulation ();
